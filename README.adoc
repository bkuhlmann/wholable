= Wholable

Wholable is a mixin that allows you to turn your object into a _whole value object_ by ensuring object equality is determined by the values of the object instead of by identity. Whole value objects -- or value objects in general -- have the following traits as also noted via link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object[Wikipedia]:

* Equality is determined by the values that make up an object and not by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(object-oriented_programming)[identity] (i.e. memory address) which is the default behavior for all {ruby_link} objects except for {data_link} and {structs_link}.
* Identity remains unique since two objects can have the same values but different identity. This means `BasicObject#equal?` is never overwritten -- which is strongly discouraged -- as per link:https://rubyapi.org/o/basicobject#method-i-3D-3D[BasicObject] documentation.
* Value objects should be immutable (i.e. frozen) by default. This implementation enforces a strict adherence to immutability in order to ensure value objects remain equal and discourage mutation.

== Features

* Ensures equality (i.e. `#==` and `#eql?`) is determined by attribute values and not object identity (i.e. `#equal?`).
* Automatically defines public attribute readers (i.e. `.attr_reader`) based on provided keys.
* Ensures object inspection (i.e. `#inspect`) shows all registered attributes.
* Ensures object is frozen upon initialization.

== Requirements

. {ruby_link}.

== Setup

To install _with_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
# ðŸ’¡ Skip this line if you already have the public certificate installed.
gem cert --add <(curl --compressed --location https://alchemists.io/projects/wholable/gems.pem)
gem install wholable --trust-policy HighSecurity
----

To install _without_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install wholable
----

You can also add the gem directly to your project:

[source,bash]
----
bundle add wholable
----

Once the gem is installed, you only need to require it:

[source,ruby]
----
require "wholable"
----

== Usage

To use, include Wholable along with a list of attributes that make up your whole value object:

[source,ruby]
----
class Person
  include Wholable[:name, :email]

  def initialize name:, email:
    @name = name
    @email = email
  end
end

jill = Person.new name: "Jill Smith", email: "jill@example.com"
jill_two = Person.new name: "Jill Smith", email: "jill@example.com"
jack = Person.new name: "Jack Smith", email: "jack@example.com"

jill.name             # "Jill Smith"
jill.email            # "jill@example.com"

jill.frozen?          # true
jill_two.frozen?      # true
jack.frozen?          # true

jill.inspect          # "#<Person @name=\"Jill Smith\", @email=\"jill@example.com\">"
jill_two.inspect      # "#<Person @name=\"Jill Smith\", @email=\"jill@example.com\">"
jack.inspect          # "#<Person @name=\"Jack Smith\", @email=\"jack@example.com\">"

jill == jill          # true
jill == jill_two      # true
jill == jack          # false

jill.eql? jill        # true
jill.eql? jill_two    # true
jill.eql? jack        # false

jill.equal? jill      # true
jill.equal? jill_two  # false
jill.equal? jack      # false

jill.hash             # 3650965837788801745
jill_two.hash         # 3650965837788801745
jack.hash             # 4460658980509842640
----

As you can see, object equality is determined by the object's values and _not_ by the object's identity. When you include `Wholable` along with a list of keys, the following happens:

. The corresponding _public_ `attr_reader` for each key is created which saves you time and reduces double entry.
. Custom `#==`, `#eql?`, `#hash`, and `#inspect` methods are added to provide whole value behavior.
. The object is immediately frozen after initialization to ensure your instance is _immutable_ by default.

== Caveats

Whole values can be broken via the following:

* *Duplication*: Sending the `#dup` message will cause your whole value object to be unfrozen. This might be desired in certain situations but make sure to refreeze when able.
* *Post Attributes*: Adding additional attributes after what is defined when including `Wholable` will break your whole value object. To prevent this, let Wholable manage this for you (easiest). Otherwise (harder), you can manually override `#==`, `#eql?`, `#hash`, and `#inspect` behavior at which point you probably don't need Wholable anymore.
* *Deep Freezing*: The automatic freezing of your instances is shallow and will not deeply freeze nested attributes. This behavior mimics the behavior of {data_link} objects.

== Influences

This implementation is based upon these original designs:

- link:https://github.com/dkubb/equalizer[Equalizer]: One of the first implementations that is over a decade old and no longer maintained.
- link:https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-equalizer[Dry Equalizer]: Deprecated and no longer maintained but was based upon the above implementation and has now moved into Dry Core.
- link:https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-core[Dry Core]: Includes the link:https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-core/equalizer[Dry::Core::Equalizer] module which is officially supported and actively maintained by the Dry RB team. A good alternative to this gem.
- link:https://github.com/piotrmurach/equatable/tree/master[Equatable]: A similar implementation to the above but is based off what you define via your `.attr_reader`. The project hasn't been maintained or updated in several years.

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/wholable
cd wholable
bin/setup
----

You can also use the IRB console for direct access to all objects:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

== Tests

To test, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/rake
